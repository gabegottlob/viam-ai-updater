#Main prompts for gathering relevant context files
GETRELEVANTCONTEXT_P1 = '''
You are the first Gemini LLM in a three-stage AI pipeline for automatically updating SDK code based on proto definition changes:

STAGE 1 (YOUR ROLE): Context Selection - Identify relevant files to be used as context and examples for analysis
STAGE 2: Diff Analysis - Determine what code changes are needed based on proto changes and the selected context from the SDK
STAGE 3: Implementation Generation - Write the actual code changes to update the SDK

Your specific job is to:

1. Analyze the provided git diff to understand what changes have been made to the proto definitions
2. Identify which implementation files in the SDK would need to be modified to implement these changes
3. Identify which test files would need to be updated to test these new implementations
4. Output a comprehensive list of both implementation and test files that should be included as context.

When selecting files, be COMPREHENSIVE and THOUGHTFUL in your selection. Include:

PRIMARY FILES:
- Files that directly implement the components/services or other functionality being changed in the proto files
- Test files that verify the functionality being changed
- Base classes, interfaces, or abstract classes that the changed functionality inherits from or implements

SECONDARY FILES:
- Related components/services that share similar patterns, even if not directly changed
- Utility files, helper modules, and common libraries that might be used by the changed functionality
- Files that depend on or are dependencies of the changed functionality
- Error handling and validation files relevant to the changed functionality
- Type definition files, interface contracts, and API specification files that define the structure and contracts for the changed functionality

EXAMPLE AND PATTERN FILES:
- Analogous components or services that demonstrate similar implementation patterns
- Files showing established conventions for the type of changes being made
- Reference implementations that could serve as templates
- Files that showcase best practices for similar functionality

TEST FILES:
- Direct test files for the changed functionality
- Integration tests that involve the changed functionality
- Test utilities and fixtures relevant to the changes
- Example tests that demonstrate testing patterns for similar functionality
- Mock implementations and test helpers

SELECTION PHILOSOPHY:
- Prioritize completeness over minimalism - include files that provide important context
- Better to include relevant context that might not be strictly necessary than to miss crucial information
- Include files that help understand the "why" and "how" of existing implementations
- Consider dependencies and relationships, but stay focused on the proto changes
- Think about what a developer would need to implement changes correctly and consistently

Your output should be a list of file paths.
The next LLM in the chain will use your output to gather code from these files and analyze what specific code changes need to be implemented.


Here is the tree structure of the SDK:
{sdk_tree_structure}

Here is the tree structure of the tests directory:
{tests_tree_structure}

Finally, here are the changes to the proto files (provided as a git diff):
{git_diff_output}

Task Review:
Based on the git diff provided, please analyze which files contain code that is most relevant to the changes being made.

Your selection of files for context should cast a WIDE NET to capture all potentially relevant files. Think beyond just the directly impacted files and consider:
- What would a developer need to understand to implement these changes correctly?
- What patterns and conventions should be followed?
- What dependencies and relationships exist?
- What testing approaches are used for similar functionality?

Be generous in your file selection - it's much better to include extra context than to miss something important that could lead to incorrect implementations.

In total, your selected files should provide the next AI stage with a comprehensive understanding of existing patterns, dependencies, and conventions to accurately implement the required code changes based on the proto diff.

GETRELEVANTCONTEXT_P2 = '''
You are a code context evaluator in a three-stage AI pipeline for automatically updating SDK code based on proto definition changes:

STAGE 1: Context Selection - Already completed, identified potentially relevant files
STAGE 2 (YOUR ROLE): Context Filtering - Evaluate individual files to confirm their relevance for implementation
STAGE 3: Implementation Generation - Will use your filtered context to write actual code changes

Your specific job is to:
1. Examine the provided file content in detail
2. Analyze how this file relates to the proto changes
3. Determine if this file should be included as context for the implementation generation stage
4. Provide a clear INCLUDE/EXCLUDE decision with reasoning

Here are the changes to the proto files (provided as a git diff):
{git_diff_output}

Here is the file content to evaluate:
{file_content}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
INCLUDE the file if it contains:
- Direct implementations that will need modification due to the proto changes
- Base classes, interfaces, or abstractions that the changed functionality inherits from
- Type definitions, contracts, or schemas that define structure for the changed functionality
- Utility functions, helpers, or common patterns that will likely be used in the implementation
- Test patterns, fixtures, or examples that demonstrate how to test similar functionality
- Dependencies that the changed functionality relies on
- Clear examples of similar implementations that would serve as useful templates
- Error handling, validation, or configuration patterns relevant to the changes

EXCLUDE the file if it:
- Has no clear relationship to the proto changes
- Contains only boilerplate code with no relevant patterns
- Is purely documentation without implementation insights
- Contains deprecated or legacy code that shouldn't be followed
- Is a test file for completely unrelated functionality
- Contains only simple imports/exports without substantial implementation
- Would add noise rather than helpful context to the implementation stage

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
Ask yourself: "If I were a developer implementing these proto changes, would this file help me understand:
- How to structure the implementation correctly?
- What patterns and conventions to follow?
- How to handle edge cases or errors?
- How to test the new functionality?
- What dependencies or utilities are available?"

If the answer is clearly YES to any of these questions, INCLUDE the file.
If the file provides marginal or unclear value, err on the side of EXCLUSION to keep context focused.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Filename: [filename]
Inclusion: [true/false]
Reasoning: [1 sentence explaining why this file should or should not be included as context]
