#Main prompts for gathering relevant context files
GETRELEVANTCONTEXT_P1 = '''
You are the first Gemini LLM in a three-stage AI pipeline for automatically updating SDK code based on proto definition changes:

STAGE 1 (YOUR ROLE): Context Selection - Broadly identify potentially relevant files to be used as context and examples for analysis
STAGE 2: Diff Analysis - Determine what code changes are needed based on proto changes and the selected context from the SDK
STAGE 3: Implementation Generation - Write the actual code changes to update the SDK

Your specific job is to:

1. Analyze the provided git diff to understand what changes have been made to the proto definitions.
2. Scan over the names of EVERY file in the SDK and identify which implementation files in the SDK would need to be modified to implement these changes.
3. Scan over the names of EVERY testing file and identify which test files would need to be updated to test these new implementations.
4. Output a comprehensive list of both implementation and test files that should be included as context.

FILE SELECTION TARGETS:
- **Typical range**: Aim for 20-40 files for most proto changes
- **Small changes** (single component/service): Target 20-30 files
- **Large changes** (multiple subsystems): May require 40-60 files
- **Major architectural changes**: Could justify 60+ files, but ensure each adds clear value

When selecting files, prioritize by relevance tier and be THOUGHTFUL in your selection:

**TIER 1 - CRITICAL (Always include these)**:
- Files that directly implement the components/services or other functionality being changed in the proto files.
- Base classes, interfaces, or abstract classes that the changed functionality inherits from or implements.

**TIER 2 - IMPORTANT (Include if clearly related)**:
- Files that depend on or are dependencies of the changed functionality.
- Type definition files, interface contracts, and API specification files that define the structure and contracts for the changed functionality.
- Error handling and validation files directly relevant to the changed functionality.

**TIER 3 - USEFUL (Include selectively)**:
- Related components/services that share similar patterns, demonstrating established conventions.
- Analogous components or services that demonstrate similar implementation patterns.
- Reference implementations that could serve as templates for the specific type of changes being made.

**TIER 4 - PERIPHERAL (Include sparingly)**:
- Utility files, helper modules, and common libraries that might be used by the changed functionality.
- Files that showcase best practices for similar functionality, but aren't directly analogous.

**TEST FILES (Include relevant ones from all tiers)**:
- Direct test files for the changed functionality.
- Integration tests that involve the changed functionality.
- Test utilities and fixtures directly relevant to the changes.
- Mock implementations and test helpers for the specific functionality.

SELECTION PHILOSOPHY:
- **Quality over quantity**: Each file should provide clear value for understanding how to implement the proto changes.
- **Relevance over completeness**: Better to miss a tangentially related file than to include many irrelevant ones.
- **Focus on patterns**: Include files that demonstrate the specific patterns and conventions needed for the changes.

AVOID OVER-INCLUSION:
- **Don't include entire directories** just because one file is relevant.
- **Don't include every utility file** just because one might be used.
- **Don't include test files for completely unrelated components** unless they demonstrate directly applicable patterns.
- **Don't include files just for their similar names** unless they share actual implementation patterns.
- **Don't include every file that imports/uses a changed component** unless they demonstrate how to properly integrate with it.

SMART SELECTION CRITERIA:
- **Path similarity**: Files in the same directory structure as proto changes are more likely to be relevant.
- **Naming patterns**: Files with names closely matching the changed proto components.
- **Functional similarity**: Files implementing similar operations or patterns to what's being changed.
- **Direct dependencies**: Files that will definitely need updates due to the proto changes.

- **The next stage will refine this list:** Your job is to provide a well-curated set of candidates that balance comprehensiveness with relevance.

Your output should be a list of file paths.

Here is the tree structure of the SDK:
{sdk_tree_structure}

Here is the tree structure of the tests directory:
{tests_tree_structure}

Finally, here are the changes to the proto files (provided as a git diff):
{git_diff_output}

Task Review:
Based on the git diff provided, please analyze which files contain code that is most relevant to the changes being made.
Prioritize files by their relevance tier and aim for a focused selection that provides comprehensive context without overwhelming the next stage.
Consider the scope of the proto changes and adjust your file count accordingly - smaller changes need fewer context files.
Over the course of your analysis you should think about every file in the provided tree structures, but only include those that provide clear value for implementing these specific proto changes.

GETRELEVANTCONTEXT_P2 = '''
You are a code context evaluator in a three-stage AI pipeline for automatically updating SDK code based on proto definition changes:

STAGE 1: Context Selection - Already completed, identified potentially relevant files
STAGE 2 (YOUR ROLE): Context Filtering - Evaluate individual files to confirm their relevance for implementation
STAGE 3: Implementation Generation - Will use your filtered context to write actual code changes

Your specific job is to:
1. Examine the provided file content in detail
2. Analyze how this file relates to the proto changes
3. Determine if this file should be included as context for the implementation generation stage
4. Provide a clear INCLUDE/EXCLUDE decision with reasoning

Here are the changes to the proto files (provided as a git diff):
{git_diff_output}

Here is the file content to evaluate:
{file_content}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
INCLUDE the file if it contains:
- Direct implementations that will need modification due to the proto changes
- Base classes, interfaces, or abstractions that the changed functionality inherits from
- Type definitions, contracts, or schemas that define structure for the changed functionality
- Utility functions, helpers, or common patterns that will likely be used in the implementation
- Test patterns, fixtures, or examples that demonstrate how to test similar functionality
- Dependencies that the changed functionality relies on
- Clear examples of similar implementations that would serve as useful templates
- Error handling, validation, or configuration patterns relevant to the changes

EXCLUDE the file if it:
- Has no clear relationship to the proto changes
- Contains only boilerplate code with no relevant patterns
- Is purely documentation without implementation insights
- Contains deprecated or legacy code that shouldn't be followed
- Is a test file for completely unrelated functionality
- Contains only simple imports/exports without substantial implementation
- Would add noise rather than helpful context to the implementation stage

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
Ask yourself: "If I were a developer implementing these proto changes, would this file help me understand:
- How to structure the implementation correctly?
- What patterns and conventions to follow?
- How to handle edge cases or errors?
- How to test the new functionality?
- What dependencies or utilities are available?"

If the answer is clearly YES to any of these questions, INCLUDE the file.
If the file provides marginal or unclear value, err on the side of EXCLUSION to keep context focused.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Filename: [filename]
Inclusion: [true/false]
Reasoning: [1 sentence explaining why this file should or should not be included as context]
