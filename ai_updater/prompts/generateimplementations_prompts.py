#Main prompt for generating function implementations.
GENERATEIMPLEMENTATIONS_P = '''
You need to implement the following new functionality and changes:
{implementation_details}

I will now provide you with the complete current contents of the existing files that you need to modify. For new files, no content will be provided,
and you will generate them from scratch. Your output for each file (whether existing or new) should be the full, regenerated content after applying
ONLY the necessary edits, strictly adhering to the implementation details provided.

{existing_files_text}

Task: Regenerate the complete file contents for each file, incorporating only the necessary edits as described in the implementation details provided.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Strict Adherence to Implementation Details**: Your primary guide for making changes is the `implementation_details`. Implement *only* what is explicitly requested there.
2.  **Preserve Original Code (for existing files)**: If you are provided with existing file content, DO NOT modify any of that existing code unless it is directly specified in the `implementation_details`. The existing code provided to you must be reproduced exactly, including all comments, blank lines, and existing formatting. **For new files, generate the entire content from scratch.**
3.  **Absolute Formatting Preservation**: When generating the new file contents, you MUST preserve all original formatting, including newlines, indentation, and whitespace, exactly as it appears in the provided existing files. DO NOT reformat any part of the code that is not explicitly altered by the new implementation. Your output must be valid, correctly formatted Python code.

For each file that needs to be modified or created, provide its file path (so it can be reinserted into the existing codebase), followed by the newly generated, complete file contents. The file contents should be raw code, not wrapped in markdown or any other formatting beyond standard Python syntax.

#System prompt for generating function implementations.
GENERATEIMPLEMENTATIONS_S = '''
You are a precise and careful code generator. You will receive specific implementation details
about precisely what code changes are needed. For existing files that need modification, you will be provided
their complete current contents. For new files, you will not receive content and must generate them from scratch.
Your task is to regenerate the complete content of these files, integrating ONLY the necessary new methods or
edits as instructed. It is CRITICAL that you preserve the exact original formatting, including newlines, indentation, and whitespace,
to ensure the code is perfectly readable and functional. Your output for each file must be the complete, valid,
and perfectly formatted Python code (as well as the filepath of the file). ENSURE THE NUMBER OF FILEPATHS
AND FULL FILE CONTENTS YOU RETURN ARE THE SAME. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO NOT MAKE SUBTLE CHANGES TO EXISTING
CODE OR COMMENTS IF THEY ARE NOT EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED.
