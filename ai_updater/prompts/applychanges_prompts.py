You need to implement the following changes for a single file:
{implementation_detail}

I will now provide you with the complete current contents of the existing file that you need to modify. If this is a new file, no content will be provided,
and you will generate it from scratch. Your output should be the full, regenerated content after applying
ONLY the necessary edits, strictly adhering to the implementation details provided.

{existing_file_content}

Task: Regenerate the complete file contents, incorporating only the necessary edits as described in the implementation details provided.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Strict Adherence to Implementation Details**: Your primary guide for making changes is the `implementation_details`. Implement *only* what is explicitly requested there.
2.  **Preserve Original Code (for existing files)**: If you are provided with existing file content, DO NOT modify any of that existing code unless it is directly specified in the `implementation_details`. The existing code provided to you must be reproduced exactly, including all comments, blank lines, and existing formatting. **For new files, generate the entire content from scratch.**
3.  **Absolute Formatting Preservation**: When generating the new file contents, you MUST preserve all original formatting, including newlines, indentation, and whitespace, exactly as it appears in the provided existing file. DO NOT reformat any part of the code that is not explicitly altered by the new implementation. Your output must be valid, correctly formatted code.

Provide the newly generated, complete file contents. The file contents should be raw code, not wrapped in markdown or any other formatting beyond standard syntax.

#System prompt for generating complete file content.
GENERATECOMPLETEFILE_S = '''
You are a precise and careful code generator. You will receive specific implementation details
about precisely what code changes are needed for a single file. For an existing file that needs modification, you will be provided
its complete current contents. For a new file, you will not receive content and must generate it from scratch.
Your task is to regenerate the complete content of this file, integrating ONLY the necessary new methods or
edits as instructed. It is CRITICAL that you preserve the exact original formatting, including newlines, indentation, and whitespace,
to ensure the code is perfectly readable and functional. Your output must be the complete, valid,
and perfectly formatted code. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO NOT MAKE SUBTLE CHANGES TO EXISTING
CODE OR COMMENTS IF THEY ARE NOT EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED.

You need to generate search-and-replace instructions for the following changes in an existing file:
{implementation_detail}

I will now provide you with the complete current contents of the existing file that you need to modify.
Your output should be search-and-replace blocks that, when applied to the `existing_file_content`,
produces the exact changes described in the `implementation_detail`.
{existing_file_content}

Task: Generate search-and-replace instructions that precisely reflect the necessary edits as described in the implementation details.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Search-and-Replace Format**: Your output MUST use the following format:
    *   Use `REPLACE:` followed by the exact text to find, then `WITH:` followed by the replacement text.
    *   Each block must contain exact whitespace, indentation, and line breaks.
2.  **Exact Text Matching**: The text after `REPLACE:` must match exactly what exists in the file - character for character, including all whitespace and indentation.
3.  **Unique Matches**: Choose search text that appears only once in the file to avoid ambiguity. Include enough context to make the match unique.
4.  **Preserve Unchanged Code**: The replacement text should include all the original code plus your additions/modifications.
5.  **No Additional Content**: Your output should contain *only* the search-and-replace blocks. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or code wrappers.

Provide the search-and-replace instructions.

Here are some examples of correctly formatted search-and-replace blocks:

Example 1: Adding a new method
Implementation Detail: "Add a new method `calculate_area(self)` that returns `self.width * self.height` to the Rectangle class in `shapes.py`."
Existing File Content:
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def get_perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)
Expected Output:
REPLACE:
    def get_perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)
WITH:
    def get_perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
Example 2: Modifying an existing function
Implementation Detail: "Update the greet function to accept an optional title parameter and include it in the greeting."
Existing File Content:
pythondef greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {{name}}!"

def farewell(name):
    return f"Goodbye, {{name}}!"
Expected Output:
REPLACE:
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {{name}}!"
WITH:
def greet(name, title=None):
    if title:
        return f"Hello, {{title}} {{name}}!"
    return f"Hello, {{name}}!"
Example 3: Multiple changes in existing file
Implementation Detail: "In utils.py, add import statement import json at the top after existing imports, and add a new function save_to_json(data, filename) at the end of the file."
Existing File Content:
pythonimport os
import sys

def load_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()

def process_text(text):
    return text.strip().upper()
Expected Output:
REPLACE:
import os
import sys
WITH:
import os
import sys
import json

REPLACE:
def process_text(text):
    return text.strip().upper()
WITH:
def process_text(text):
    return text.strip().upper()

def save_to_json(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
